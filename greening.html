    <h1>Make it Greener</h1>
    <p>What about a fresh area – that is filled with oxygen, to live in? 
        This campaign does include planting 100 trees every week. At the end of every month, we get 400 trees planted. This gives us a fresher and healthier environment. Also, it plays an important role in avoiding sandstorms that happen a lot especially in the eastern countries, like ours – Iraq.
