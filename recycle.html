    <h1>From trash to treasure</h1>
    <p> Making a new thing from an old used thing, good idea, ha?
        One of the campaigns that we have started is recycling. It includes recycling plastic, paper and even fabric. If you join the campaign, you will only have to keep anything you think could be recycled (plastic bottles, copybooks that you do not use anymore, old clothes, etc..), and put them in a box then give it to us in the weekend - when we gather. The environment will get environment happy if you join, hence; we will all get the same feeling.
